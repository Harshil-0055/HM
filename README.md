## 📄Hi, I'm a driven student at ICT (GTU, Gujarat ) diving into branch-core subjects like IoT, digital circuits, VLSI, Python, and communication systems. Obsessed with the physics powering behind the system. Learn core concept to master Vlsi/digital circuits, IoT/comms essentials. 

##🔵Tech skills :
Python ( basics) 
Java (basics)
Verilog

## 🛠️ Tools & Platforms
- **Python**: VS Code, Jupyter Notebook.
 
- **Verilog/VLSI**: Quartus, MCU IDE.
  
- **IoT/Embedded**: MIT App Inventor, Arduino IDE.
  
## Interests & LearningCore obsessions:
Semiconductor physics: Doping, bandgaps, fabrication nodes—reading
VLSI: Gate-level optimization, timing analysis—aim for ASIC flows.
IoT/Comms: Protocols (MQTT, BLE), edge security vulns.
